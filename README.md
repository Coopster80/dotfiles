# dotfiles
Backup for my dotfiles.

Feel free to steal + adapt, the vast majority of my config has been borrowed from helpful people from around the web.

* Run ```./install.sh``` to install all of the dotfiles into your home directory. (minus my work configs)
* Run ```./install.sh help``` to see individual dotfile installation options.

Fair warning: The installation will silently overwrite your existing dotfiles.

### Requirements
* Git
* Vim
* 24-bit color support in terminal (including tmux)
* Tmux 2.2 or higher
