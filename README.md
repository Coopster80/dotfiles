# dotfiles
Backup for my dotfiles.

Feel free to steal + adapt, the vast majority of my config has been borrowed from helpful people from around the web.

* Run ```./setup.sh all``` to install all of the dotfiles into your home directory. (minus work conifgs)
* Run ```./setup.sh``` without any options to see individual dotfile installation options.

Fair warning: The installation will silently overwrite your existing dotfiles.

### Requirements

* 24-bit color support in terminal (including tmux)
* Tmux 2.2 or higher
