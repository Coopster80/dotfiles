# dotfiles
Backup for my dotfiles.

Feel free to steal + adapt, the vast majority of my config has been stolen
from helpful people from around the web.

* Run ```make install``` to install all of the dotfiles into your home directory.
* Run ```make``` without a target to see the individual dotfile target options.

Fair warning: The installation will silently overwrite your existing dotfiles.

### Requirements

* Windows 10 with Subsystem for Linux
* 24-bit colour support in terminal (including tmux)
* Tmux 2.2 or higher
* Vim
* Git
